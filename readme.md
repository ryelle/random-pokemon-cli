Random Pokemon CLI
==================

You were definitely missing the ability to get a random pokemon name & description via command line. Now you're not!

If you're really into this, you can install it yourself! Follow me…

1. Get the files: clone the project or [download the zip](https://github.com/ryelle/random-pokemon-cli/archive/master.zip).
2. `npm install` to get the few dependencies
3. `npm run pokemon` to run it. (you can also just run `node index.js` but I like the custom script name)

It'll tell you to have patience, since the API isn't the fastest thing, then you'll have a pokemon!

                           Vulpix
------------------------------------------------------------
Inside Vulpix’s body burns a flame that never goes out.
During the daytime, when the temperatures rise, this
Pokémon releases flames from its mouth to prevent its body
from growing too hot.
